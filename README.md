fuzzyZeit
=========

pebble watch face displaying fuzzy time in German.
Inspired by numerous examples in other languages, however, the code is written entirely by Jonas Zimmermann (2013).

Initialize as usual:
../tools/create_pebble_project.py --symlink-only ../sdk fuzzyZeit.git
(and adjust your paths).
then run
./waf configure
./wat build

Note you'll have to provide your own fonts (see resources/src/fonts/FontReadme.md)

Feel free to share. No guarantees.
